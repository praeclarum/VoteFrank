    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m running because I believe I can bring a compassionate and reasoned voice to city council. I am a small business owner and an optimist who thinks District 4 is an amazing place to live in Seattle and I want to ensure that it becomes even more amazing in the future. I look forward to bringing my spirit, rigor, and strong work ethic to public office.</p>
